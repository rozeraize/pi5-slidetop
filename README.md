# pi5-slidetop
A Raspberry Pi 5 laptop with a unique sliding and opening hinge. 

The hinge and various other parts of the laptop was inspired by the laptop created by the YouTube channel of 'TecH BoyS ToyS'. Here is a link to his video: https://youtu.be/jntHraUABHo?si=zRmpOkPDyJXu36e1




 Of course there are many differences between his laptop and mine. In fact even the hinges are different, even though my hinge is based off of his. the size is different (since I chose a smaller screen), I am using a camera module, I am also using the Pi5 and not the Pi4, none of the parts in my design are soldered (because I dont know how to solder), and other differences.


WARNING: the 3D models on this repo are not finished. I will post updates and refinements on this repo as I work on this project. I just wanted to get this on GitHub as soon as possible. Also if you dont understand what each 3D model is for and why it is made the why it is, don't worry, your  not meant to. I didn't get around to adding comments and proper schematics and documentation, It is just the CAD files for now.
